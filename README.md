## Technical Implementation Notes
- **Surrogate Keys**: All primary keys utilize `SERIAL` (auto-incrementing integer) for optimal indexing performance.
- **Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` default to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
- **Integrity**: Referential integrity is strictly enforced via **Foreign Key Constraints**. Business logic (e.g., updating `stock_quantity` on purchase) is handled via **Database Triggers**.
- **Derived Attributes**: Fields like `avg_rating` in `PRODUCTS` are calculated based on inserts/updates to the `REVIEWS` table.
